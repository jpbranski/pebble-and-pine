  "longDescription": "This stunning coastal retreat marries contemporary minimalism with organic textures inspired by the Pacific shoreline. Every design choice—from the driftwood-inspired fixtures to the sand-hued textile palette—celebrates the home's relationship with the ocean. Floor-to-ceiling windows frame ever-changing seascapes, while carefully curated furnishings in linen, rattan, and reclaimed wood create warmth without competing with the views. The result is a sanctuary that feels both luxurious and effortlessly relaxed, where the boundary between indoors and outdoors dissolves into tranquil harmony.",
