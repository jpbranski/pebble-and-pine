  "longDescription": "This primary suite transforms a standard bedroom into a botanical sanctuary that celebrates the healing power of nature. The design layers rich textures—linen bedding, woven grasscloth wallcovering, and a handcrafted rattan headboard—to create depth and tactile interest. A carefully curated palette of sage, moss, and cream evokes the serenity of a forest clearing, while live plants and botanical artwork reinforce the connection to the natural world. Custom window treatments in organic cotton filter light beautifully, and a cozy reading nook with a vintage velvet chair provides the perfect spot for morning coffee. Every element works together to create a restful retreat that nurtures both body and spirit.",
